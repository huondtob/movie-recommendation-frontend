# Movie Recomendation Frontend

## Getting Started
To get the project running first it is required to have the yarn dependency manager.
(https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

### Install Dependencies
`yarn install`

### Start
`yarn start`

The Frontend is now avaliable on http://localhost:3000/

## Code Style
We make use of eslint to ensure a consistent code style throughout the project.
We write the code in an ES2015+ style  and we prefer the use
of classes and the ```import``` statement.
We follow the Airbnb javascript style guidelines: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript.

## Docstyle
We use JSDoc (http://usejsdoc.org) to document code. Preferably no inline comments should be necessary. Docstrings should only be added if they add information and not just to include them.
